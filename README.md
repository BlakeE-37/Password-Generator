# Random Password Generator

## Description

This is a website coded in HTML, and CSS. It contains a header with my name, a picture of me, and links to the sections below. I also included a hero image, links to my past projects in the form of images, and links to my social media and email at the bottom.  

This site is for employers to see a more mainstream form of my resume and for me to show off some of my skills as a front end developer.

## Installation

The website is hosted with github pages and can be accessed at [this link](https://blakee-37.github.io/Challenge-2/)

Below is an image of the loaded website.
